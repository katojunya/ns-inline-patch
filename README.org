see https://qiita.com/takaxp/items/e07bb286d80fa9dd8e05

** Supported features
 - avoid "M-x „ÅÇ"
 - faces for composing text
 - non ja locale
 - directly change input source

** Supported Emacs version
 - Emacs HEAD, 27.0.60 (emacs-27.1-inline.patch)
 - Emacs 26.3, 26.2, 26.1 (emacs-25.2-inline.patch)
 - Emacs 25.2, 25.3 (emacs-25.2-inline.patch)

** [TEST] pre-built distribution package

You can download my pre-built Emacs 27 with ns-inline patch. Emacs.app will be installed under =/Applications/Emacs-takaxp=.

https://github.com/takaxp/ns-inline-patch/raw/master/pkg/emacs-27-406fb0746c.pkg

Before you run the package, you will probably need to install some external packages as follows:

#+begin_src sh
brew install gnutls
brew install imagemagck // or imagemagick@6
#+end_src

I'll revisit this issue near future. If you face some issues, please let me know.

Enjoy!

** How to use?

Add the following code to your init.el.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (and (memq window-system '(ns nil))
           (fboundp 'mac-get-current-input-source))
  (when (version< "27.0" emacs-version)
    ;; Required for some cases when auto detection is failed or the locale is "en".
    (custom-set-variables
     '(mac-default-input-source "com.google.inputmethod.Japanese.base")))
  (mac-input-method-mode 1))
#+end_src

** Build scripts

For your convenience, some build scripts are provided. Before you run the script, please run =setup.sh= first.

#+begin_src sh
sh ./build/setup.sh
sh ./build/emacs-27.1.sh
#+end_src

If your environment for building Emacs is under PROXY, you can use =emacs-mirror= to get Emacs source codes. Please change the URL of the git repository specified in =emacs-head.sh= and =emacs-27.1.sh= if needed.

** Pre-built distribution package

You can download my pre-built Emacs 26.3 and 27.1 with ns-inline patch. =Emacs.app= will be installed under =/Applications/Emacs-takaxp= in your macOS. The pkg contains =GnuTLS= and it supports Catalina only.
